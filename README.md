# CardUdacityProject1 - comparison of layouts - Relative/Linear layout vs. Constraint layout

**Hi everyone**

As you know, some time ago, Android introduced a new type of layout - the Constraint Layout (which unfortunately is not yet presented in our course) but nothing is losted!
I encourage you to learn because thanks to ConstraintLayout you can achieve really a lot.

I prepared a two cards for you (as the first project) you will think that they look very similar but are built on different layouts. 
You can switch using the button between layouts.

As you can see, **relative layout with a linear layout** - have a charcharchic structure - as we learned on the course - 
is a parent layout and children's layouts

**Constraint layout** - has a linear structure - elements are not included in parent layouts, but the position of each element depends on the position of the next. 
This layout allows you to build more universal and complicated layouts.

Thanks to that we were able to create a much more complicated layout for our game about tadpoles. In the game, many elements are stacked one above the other. 
Creating such a layout with a relative and lineart layouts would be much more difficult.


once again, I encourage you to learn and I leave a link to the home page of the layout creators - you can learn the basics there:
